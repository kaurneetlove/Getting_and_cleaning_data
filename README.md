1.A tidy data set

2.A link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis

3.A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

4.Analysis R Script

# In run_analysis.R

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

1.Load Packages and get the Data.

2.Load activity labels + features.

3.Load training datasets.

4.Load test datasets

5.merge datasets.

6.Create a new dataset.


# In tidyData.txt

The newly created dataset in run_analysis.R is present.
